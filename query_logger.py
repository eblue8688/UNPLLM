UNPLLM - Stage 3: Query logging
Every query sent to /generate_rag gets logged here: what was asked,
how well it matched the knowledge base, and whether it counts as a
"gap" (something the local knowledge base doesn't cover well).

This log is what the sync engine (Week 14+) will read to decide what
to fetch the next time the internet is available.
